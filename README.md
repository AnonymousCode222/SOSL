Revisiting Scaling Laws for Language Models: The Role of Data Quality and Training Strategies

Traditional scaling laws in natural language processing suggest that increasing model size and training data enhances performance. However, recent studies reveal deviations, particularly in large language models, where performance improvements decelerateâ€”a phenomenon known as sub-scaling. This paper revisits these scaling laws by examining the impact of data quality and training strategies on model performance.
Through extensive empirical analysis of over 400 models, we identify high data density and non-optimal resource allocation as key factors contributing to sub-scaling. High data density leads to diminishing returns due to redundant information, while optimal resource allocation is crucial for sustained performance improvements. We propose a sub-optimal scaling law that better predicts performance in sub-scaling regimes, highlighting the importance of data quality and diversity.
